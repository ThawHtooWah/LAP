## Which process model is best suited for risk management and give its advantages and disadvantages? 
There are two characteristics of risk i.e. uncertainty and loss.

### Categories of risk
Following are the categories of the risk:
1. **Project risk**
   - If the project risk is real then it is probable that the project schedule will slip and the cost of the project will increase.
   - It identifies the potential schedule, resource, stakeholders and the requirements problems and their impact on a software project.
2. **Technical risk**
   - If the technical risk is real then the implementation becomes impossible. 
   - It identifies potential design, interface, verification and maintenance of the problem.
3. **Business risk**   
If the business risk is real then it harms the project or product. There are five sub-categories of the business risk. 
   - Market risk - Creating an excellent system that no one really wants.
   - Strategic risk - Creating a product which no longer fit into the overall business strategy for companies.
   - Sales risk - The sales force does not understand how to sell a creating product.
   - Management risk - Loose a support of senior management because of a change in focus.
   - Budget risk - losing a personal commitment.  

**Other risk categories**  
These categories suggested by Charette.
   - Known risks : These risk are unwrapped after the project plan is evaluated.
   - Predictable risks : These risks are estimated from previous project experience.
   - Unpredictable risks : These risks are unknown and are extremely tough to identify in advance.

### Principles of risk management   
  - **Maintain a global perspective** - View software risks in the context of a system and the business problem planned to solve.
  - **Take a forward looking view** - Think about the risk which may occur in the future and create future plans for managing the future events.
  - **Encourage open communication** - Encourage all the stakeholders and users for suggesting risks at any time.
  - **Integrate** - A consideration of risk should be integrated into the software process.
  - **Emphasize a continuous process** - Modify the identified risk than the more information is known and add new risks as better insight is achieved.
  - **Develop a shared product vision** - If all the stakeholders share the same vision of the software then it is easier for better risk identification.
  - **Encourage teamwork** - While conducting risk management activities pool the skills and experience of all stakeholders.

### Risk Identification   
It is a systematic attempt to specify threats to the project plans.
Two different types of risk:
- **Generic risks**
   - These risks are a potential threat to each software project.
- **Product-specific risks**
   - These risks are recognized by those with a clear understanding of the technology, the people and the environment which is specific to the software that is to be built.
   - A method for recognizing risks is to create item checklist.
