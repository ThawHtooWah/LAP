## Software Testing

Software testing may be defined as a process whose objective is to find the problem in implementation of a program. 
Execution of this program is very much needed for the software project. 
According to IEEE testing means, the process of exercise or evaluating a system or its component by manual or automated means to
- Audit about the necessary needs completed by software testing.
- Get the value of difference between proposed result and actual result.

For making the simple process of software testing it is required that activities are broken in small size. 
Generally this method is used and system is divided in sub systems. All those sub system tested individually before the process of system testing start. 
Under the process of software testing three steps are taken. Individual module is the main part of focus during unit testing step. 
After the unit testing, all individual modules are combined with each other. 
After this step software testing process start and developer have focus on complete software system.

### Unit testing
This is the first step of the process of software testing and on this step programmer confirm about the function performed by the module. The software have smallest unit which is called module. After the development of source code unit testing start and it verifies for the right syntax. The primary goal of the unit testing is to get the minimum unit which will be able to taste and confirm that it works or not. Every single module tested separately. After testing all individual modules are combined with each other. Some tests are taken under the process of unit testing process which is:

- **Nature test of module** - In the test of a module nature we verify that the flow of information is positive in tested module under that situation which is specified for the unit test.
- **Performable test** - This checkout point have the objective to calculate the time period of response, started time, last time and during the whole process time and communication between links.
- **Local data structure test** - Storage of local data is checked under this step that all the data and information collected in systematic way or not.
- **Boundary test** - This test is performed for the surety that the information provided by the software is true or not under those conditions which are given by the users.
- **Independent path test** - Under this test it is checked that the given task is properly executed or not and working ok. Only with the help of this test can check it.
- **Error handling test** - The error which occurred during the process is properly handled or not. This type of information provided under this test.

#### Process of unit testing
In the process of unit testing there is need to required data or information about other module. With the help of driver and stubs we can easily get. A programmer which gives the test and passes it to where module tested is called driver. Which programs used to replace module and subordinates of the module being tested is called stubs. Stubs and driver are the need of unit testing process. Quantity of stubs and drives can be reduced if they have the quality of simplicity.
