## Software Testing

Software testing may be defined as a process whose objective is to find the problem in implementation of a program. 
Execution of this program is very much needed for the software project. 
According to IEEE testing means, the process of exercise or evaluating a system or its component by manual or automated means to
- Audit about the necessary needs completed by software testing.
- Get the value of difference between proposed result and actual result.

For making the simple process of software testing it is required that activities are broken in small size. 
Generally this method is used and system is divided in sub systems. All those sub system tested individually before the process of system testing start. 
Under the process of software testing three steps are taken. Individual module is the main part of focus during unit testing step. 
After the unit testing, all individual modules are combined with each other. 
After this step software testing process start and developer have focus on complete software system.
